# Project Objective

Write Tweets and List Recent Tweets in your CLI by using Python3 and Twitter API.

## Information Inputs

The inputs of the APP are a Create Tweet script and a List Recent Tweets script that are consolidated in the Twitter_app.py file. Once run, the app will prompt you to create a new tweet.  This can include updates or tweeting at other users.  

## Information Outputs

After inputing your tweet, the desired output will reflect a menu at the top listing your twitter handle, number of users you are following, and the number of your followers. Under the menu will list the tweet itself, along with your most recent tweets.  The list of recent tweets will contain the tweet ID, time/ date of the tweet, and the actual tweet.
